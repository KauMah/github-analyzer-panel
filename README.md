This project serves as a visual dashboard for the data collected by my other project [GithubAnalyzer](http://github.com/Kaumah/GithubAnalyzer)

At the time of writing, the binary generated by that project spits out all commit data on stdout.

## Scripts

```bash
# (assuming local development) install and run postgresql
# change db url in .env to point to your local instance
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql


# Initialize database and generate prisma client
pnpm db:push
pnpm generate
# start the development server
pnpm dev

```
